# Interactive 3D Sphere: Three.js Crash Course Project

Welcome to the "Interactive 3D Sphere" project! This project showcases an engaging 3D sphere that gracefully orbits and responds to user interactions. It's built using Three.js, GSAP animations, and Vite for a fast development experience.

## Highlights

- üåê Explore an interactive 3D sphere that elegantly orbits and changes colors with mouse movements.
- üöÄ Inspired by "developedbyed's" tutorial, I've employed Three.js and GSAP animations to bring this project to life.
- üåà Experience the dynamic visuals and interactive nature of 3D web graphics firsthand.

## Tech Stack

- Three.js: Leveraging Three.js to create captivating 3D visuals and scenes.
- GSAP: Utilizing GSAP animations for seamless transitions and dynamic effects.
- Vite: Fast build tool and development server for rapid development.

## Learning Journey

This project embodies my passion for continuous learning and growth. Starting with the "Three.js Crash Course For Beginners," I've expanded my skills and knowledge to create this captivating 3D web experience.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/Akshit-Zom/Interactive-3D-Sphere-Three.js-Crash-Course-Project.git`
2. Open the project directory in your preferred code editor.

### Using Vite:

3. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Launch the development server using `npm run dev`.
5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000` to interact with the 3D sphere.
